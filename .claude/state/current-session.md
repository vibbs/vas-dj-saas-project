# Session State

> Multi-session continuity. Update at session end or major milestones.

## Current Goal
Self-improving agent system fully implemented

## Status
- [x] System design complete
- [x] Infrastructure files created
- [x] CLAUDE.md refactored (62 lines, under 100 budget)
- [x] Documentation moved to references
- [x] .gitignore updated

## Completed This Session
- Analyzed self-improving agent patterns from GitHub Gist
- Created `.claude/learnings/` directory with tracking template
- Created `.claude/rules/` directory for promoted patterns
- Created `.claude/state/` for session continuity
- Created `.claude/processes/` for complex workflows
- Created `.claude/docs/project-reference.md` with detailed documentation
- Refactored CLAUDE.md from 260 to 62 lines with bootstrap prompts
- Updated .gitignore for new structure

## Next Steps
1. Use the system during normal development
2. Capture learnings as discoveries are made
3. Monitor learnings count for promotion triggers
4. First consolidation expected around session 15+

## Blockers
None

## Context Notes
- User wanted full self-improving system tailored for VAS-DJ project
- System follows evolution pathway: Bootstrap → Capture → Promotion → Consolidation
- Learnings, rules, processes are tracked in git (team knowledge)
- Token budgets: CLAUDE.md ~100 lines, Rules ~200 lines total, ~30 active learnings
